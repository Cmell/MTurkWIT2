In this task, you will see two images on each trial. The first image will be a face, and the second image will be an object. The face is not important, but only signals that the object is about to appear. When the object appears, it is your job to identify it as a gun or a non-gun. If the object is a gun, press the "i" key. If the object is something else (such as a tool or a wallet), press the "e" key.

If you take too long, you will have to press the spacebar to continue. The task is designed to be fast and difficult, so you will make mistakes. That is ok! Try to be accurate, but know that most people make some errors, especially at the start of the task.
